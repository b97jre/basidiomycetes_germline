# basidiomycetes_germline

## Summary
In sexual organisms, trans-generational inheritance of genetic material is controlled by the germline. 
Transmission of new mutations is highly dependent on the timing of germline definition, where a late definition, close to gamete production, allows somatic mutations to enter the germline, while an early definition acts as a transmission barrier.
Fungi are assumed to define the germline at a late developmental stage since they possess the ability to reform mycelia from single-cells. Here, we investigated the transmission of somatic mutations in the mushroom-forming fungus Marasmius oreades. 
We collected mushrooms over a seven-year period, separated different tissues including the meiotically formed spores, and identified new mutations by whole-genome sequencing. 
We found a perfect distinction between tissue types, where sterile (stipe, cap) and fertile tissues (lamellae, spores) from different mushrooms carried different sets of mutations. 
This result suggests that cell fate in mushroom-forming fungi is predetermined, and that the germline, destined for spore production, is already defined in the mycelium. 
Moreover, the germline carried relatively fewer mutations than sterile tissues, indicating a lower mutation rate. 
Our findings reveal previously hidden facets of fungal development, and suggest that germline sequestration may be more widespread than previously considered across multicellular life.
